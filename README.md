# Minesweeper with AI

This Python script represents a Minesweeper game where a player can play with the option of using an AI to make the most optimal move. The Minesweeper AI in this script uses a knowledge-based approach to make decisions about which cells to mark as mines or uncover as safe. The primary algorithm implemented is a simplified version of logical inference.
